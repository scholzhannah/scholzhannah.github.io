<h1>Hannah Scholz</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Hannah Scholz. I am happy you're visting my page :). This is very much a work in progress and I have no idea how to use html so please excuse the mess...</p>
<p>I am currently a Bachelor's student in my sixth semester at the University of Bonn. This semester I am writing my Bachelor's thesis trying to formalize CW-complexes in <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">lean</a>. My supervisor is <a href="https://florisvandoorn.com/">Prof. Floris van Doorn</a>. See my github repository for this project <a href="https://github.com/scholzhannah/CWComplexes">here</a>. </p>
<p>Aside from mathematics I am also interested in supporting women in STEM. If you're in Bonn check out the <a href="https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/hcm/community/tea-time-with-women-in-mathematics">Tea Time with Women in Mathematics</a>; I co-organize some of these events. I also participate in mentoring school-aged girls interested in STEM. If you would like to do that too, check out <a href="https://www.cybermentorin.de/index.php/en/">Cybermentor</a> which is the program I am participating in. </p>
