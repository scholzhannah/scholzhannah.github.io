title: A review of five mathematical fiction books
excerpt: Talking about my impression on five mathematical fiction books, from the perspective of a mathematics student.
---

I have been getting into reading again over the summer and coincidentally read "The bookkeeper and the professor" which is the first book I will discuss. 
Enjoying how it featured mathematical themes I went out in search of similar books. 
I stumbled on [this amazing webpage](https://kasmana.people.charleston.edu/MATHFICT/) on which Alex Kasman has collected over 1500 works of mathematical fiction. 
I highly recommend just looking through this database. 
Now onto the actual reviews. 

# 1. "The Housekeeper and the Professor" by Y≈çko Ogawa and translated to English by Stephen Snyder

Like I mentioned above, this is the first work of mathematical fiction that I read. 
It had been gifted to me a year earlier and had been standing on my bookshelf untouched until I got my motivation to read back. 

---- I should reread the book and then finish this. 

## Brief Summary

The narrator of the book is a housekeeper that gets assigned to a very difficult job, one that many before her have given up on: she is to care for a retired maths professor whose memory only lasts for 80 minutes due to an accident. 
He is often anxious and masks his nervousness by blabbing on about maths and especially specific numbers like the housekeepers birthday or ???.

## My Impression

## Mathematical prerequisites

This book was recommended to me by my mother who herself got the recommendation from my grandmother, both of which have never found great enjoyment in mathematics. 
So you can take it from them that this book doesn't require any familiarity with mathematics to be enjoyed.
On the contrary, I think "The Housekeeper and the Professor" tries to bring maths closer to those who have not previously enjoyed it. 
I invites you to follow the housekeepers and Roots explorations into the professors riddles and hopefully find a similar joy in them. 
Some of the reviews I read mentioned how they just skipped all the equations and explanations because they did not like maths. 
They still seemed to enjoy the book and ultimately I think you should read for your own enjoyment but I still feel they are missing out on a central premise of the book. 
I of course could not really experience this myself but I hope that this book could be a way for people to see the beauty in mathematics that so often is not visible in the maths taught in school.
