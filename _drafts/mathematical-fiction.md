title: A review of five mathematical fiction books
excerpt: Talking about my impression on five mathematical fiction books, from the perspective of a mathematics student.
---

I have been getting into reading again over the summer and coincidentally read "The bookkeeper and the professor" which is the first book I will discuss. 
Enjoying how it featured mathematical themes I went out in search of similar books. 
I stumbled on [this amazing webpage](https://kasmana.people.charleston.edu/MATHFICT/) on which Alex Kasman has collected over 1500 works of mathematical fiction. 
I highly recommend just looking through this database. 
Now onto the actual reviews. 

# 1. "The Housekeeper and the Professor" by Yōko Ogawa and translated to English by Stephen Snyder

Like I mentioned above, this is the first work of mathematical fiction that I read. 
It had been gifted to me a year earlier and had been standing on my bookshelf untouched until I got my motivation to read back. 

---- I should reread the book and then finish this. 

## Brief Summary

The narrator of the book is a housekeeper that gets assigned to a very difficult job, one that many before her have given up on: she is to care for a retired maths professor whose memory only lasts for 80 minutes due to an accident. 
He is often anxious and masks his nervousness by blabbing on about maths and especially specific numbers like the housekeepers birthday or ???.

## Mathematical prerequisites

This book was recommended to me by my mother who herself got the recommendation from my grandmother, both of which have never found great enjoyment in mathematics. 
So you can take it from them that this book doesn't require any familiarity with mathematics to be enjoyed.
On the contrary, I think "The Housekeeper and the Professor" tries to bring maths closer to those who have not previously enjoyed it. 
I invites you to follow the housekeepers and Roots explorations into the professors riddles and hopefully find a similar joy in them. 
Some of the reviews I read mentioned how they just skipped all the equations and explanations because they did not like maths. 
They still seemed to enjoy the book and ultimately I think you should read for your own enjoyment but I still feel they are missing out on a central premise of the book. 
I of course could not really experience this myself but I hope that this book could be a way for people to see the beauty in mathematics that so often is not visible in the maths taught in school. 

# 2. "Flatland - Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions" by Edwin A. Abbot (1884)

After deciding on my quest to read mathematical fiction, I of course needed to move on to what might be considered the absolute classic of this genre: Flatland.
It is such a classic that the local library in Bonn had it available and I think I had even seen an animated version of it at some math competition, although I remember nothing at all about it. 

## Summary

It is really hard to convey any impression of the book without spoiling a considerable amount of content (this book is more of a novella at 96 pages). 
Nevertheless, I think this book is less about its plot and more about considering what a society in two dimensions might look like. 
The ending is even spoilered in the preface of the book and I will do the same in this summary.
So you have been warned. 

The book is written from the perspective of a square-person living in a two-dimensional world called Flatland. 
The first half of the book discusses Flatland itself, while the second half discusses the squares encounters with other dimensions. 
While "Flatland" is known mostly for its mathematical content, more specifically the imagination of different dimensions, it is as much a book about maths as it is a satirical commentary on the society the author lived in (Victorian England).

The inhabitants of Flatland are all geometric shapes, ranging from lines, over triangles to spheres (or rather polygons with so many points that they are impossible to distinguish from spheres). 
Flatland has a rigid class system that is based on that geometry. 
The lowest class are, of course, women. (I will discuss the treatment of women and sexism in this book in more detail in the section "My impression").
The lowest class of men are the Isosceles (triangles with two sides of the same length), they are followed by equilateral triangles, then squares and so on. 
The justification for this hierarchy is that shapes with few points have sharper angles and are therefore dangerous (women being the most dangerous), while shapes with a lot of points are peaceful and have a lot of space to fit their brain, which supposedly makes them smarter.
The inhabitants take on different jobs depending on their class. 
The lowest of the Isosceles (i.e. those with a very acute angle) are immovable statues used for teaching, some of the Isosceles with angles closer to 60 degrees are slaves or even soldiers. 
The nobility starts with the hexagons. 
The circles are priests and the "roundest" of them is the monarch. 
Women are housewives. 

The classes are further distinguished by the education they receive. 
One of the main subject of learning in Flatland is how to distinguish different shapes, which you can easily imagine to be hard as a two dimensional creature. 
There are different methods for this and they are considered varying levels of cultured. 
Irregular shapes are hard to identify using the most highly regarded technique of recognition by sight (approximating the angle by analysing the difference in brightness on different parts of the shape). 
As such they are regarded as a danger to the system and are either killed, imprisoned or treated with surgery. 
Families can rise through the classes one generation at the time (or half a degree for Isosceles) provided they behave in a cultured manner. 
The monarch and his supporters are entirely concerned with upholding the social hierarchy: killing or imprisoning anyone with ambitions to revolutionize the system or even new scientific discoveries or techniques that could cause shifts in the class system. 

One day, the square has a dream in which he sees Lineland, a one dimensional world. 
As inhabitants of Lineland cannot pass each other, their culture relies entirely on verbal exchanges. 
Additionally, since the men of Lineland (which are lines while the women are points) cannot turn, they have two different mouths and therefore voices, one for every direction. 
As said before, their entire lives rely on their voices, even their procreation. 
Marriages are therefore made up of one man and two women, one male voice for each female one. 
To preserve biological balance, two women are born for every man. 

A little afterwards the square is visited by a sphere. (Apparently Spaceland tries to inform Flatland of the existence of another dimension every thousand years for some reason.) 
The sphere, of course, appears to him as a two-dimensional object: a circle of varying diameter. 
When the square isn't making much progress towards understanding the third dimension, the sphere lifts it out of Flatland to look down upon it and at Spaceland. 
Seeing all this, the square begins to understand the nature of three dimensions and the abstract reasons that the sphere had given for its existence. 
Following this logic further, the square concludes that there must be even more dimensions. 
This angers the sphere and the square is promptly thrown back into Flatland. 
Back in Flatland the square tries to enlighten other people about the existence of three dimensions for which he is thrown in jail. 

## My Impression

I really liked this book. 
I think ot would be a great read for a book club as there are many different aspects to discuss: the satire of Victorian society, the mathematics of different dimensions and the portrayal of women. 
Having no idea whatsoever about Victorian England, I will skip this aspect and just say that the satire is still funny today and parts of it continue being relevant.
I will discuss the mathematical content in more detail in the section "Mathematical prerequisites". 
This aspect is extremely well done: the reader is led to consider how lower and higher dimensions might work in a very slow, fun and creative manner. 
It is never dull and there are drawings to illustrate parts of the text that might be slightly more difficult to understand. 

I want to dedicate the rest of the section to the authors portrayal of women in the book. 
Apparently, the possible sexism of the depiction itself was already criticised when the book came out as the preface addresses this criticism with the following words (written in the third person as if the author was conveying the thoughts of the square): 

> [I]n the course of an imprisonment of seven years he has himself modifies his own personal views, both as regards Women and as regards the Isosceles or Lower Classes.

and

> [W]riting as Historian, he has identified himself (perhaps too closely) with the views generally adopted by Flatland[.]

In a vacuum, the depiction of women is good satire: 
Women in Flatland are dangerous creatures, so dangerous in fact that they are prone to killing their entire families in fits of emotion.
For this reason, their lives are heavily regulated: They need to constantly sway their bodies from side to side and emit a "peace-cry" so that no one might accidentally face them head one (as in this position they are nearly invisible being a line) and kill themselves running into them. 
In other regions of the world they are locked in their houses or always accompanied by a man. 
Despite this acute danger they are also described as very frail. 
Additionally, women are described as emotional and dumb. 
Men generally know two ways of speaking: the inferior way filled with emotion that is reserved for their wives and the superior way of maths and logic reserved for other men. 
Every time the square wants to convey that something is easy to understand he says that even a woman could grasp it. 
All in all, I think this is still a funny and applicative satire of sexism. 

So then what is there to take issue with? 
If you have read the summary I have provided above, you will know that all other societal aspects are not discussed in that literal of a manner, instead they try to fit logically into the peculiarities of Flatland. 
The author could imagine a world where the class system is based on the number of points of the polygons, 
where the hight of good culture is to recognize the shape of your conversation partner by sight, one where families of high status pay for their children to be surgically altered to have more points (often killing them in the process), and one where irregular shapes don't fit the preconceived moulds and are killed.
He could imagine another world (namely Lineland), in which marriages are formed by three people and all of life is carried out via verbal communication. 

But he could not imagine a world in which women would not be literally one dimension lower than their male counterparts and seen as hysterical and incapable of intelligent thought. 
It seems to have appeared so natural to him, that he didn't even think it necessary to find a metaphor for it. 
There are other concepts the book takes from our world without any change: monarchy, education and universities, houses, trees and rain for example.
The book thus presents the discrimination and inferiority of women as similarly natural.

Nevertheless, it is easy for me to forgive the author and see this as a natural product of the time (1884 in case you have forgotten), especially due to the admission to his past misguided views in the preface. 
Seeing monarchy among the list of "natural concepts" really puts the age of this book into perspective. 
For the 
Personally, I think that the satirical tone of the book makes it so the constant belittlement of women doesn't even leave a sour taste in your mouth. 
But I think it is an interesting aspect to keep in mind while reading and discussing.
