I have been getting into reading again over the summer and coincidentally read "The Housekeeper and the Professor" which is the first book I will discuss. 
Enjoying how it featured mathematical themes I went out in search of similar books. 
I stumbled upon [this amazing webpage](https://kasmana.people.charleston.edu/MATHFICT/) on which Alex Kasman has collected over 1500 works of mathematical fiction. 
I highly recommend just looking through this database. 
Now onto the actual reviews. 

# 1. "The Housekeeper and the Professor" by Yōko Ogawa and translated to English by Stephen Snyder

Like I mentioned above, this is the first work of mathematical fiction that I read. 
It had been gifted to me a year earlier and had been standing on my bookshelf untouched until I got my motivation to read back. 

---- I should reread the book and then finish this. 

## Brief Summary

The narrator of the book is a housekeeper that gets assigned to a very difficult job, one that many before her have given up on: she is to care for a retired maths professor whose memory only lasts for 80 minutes due to an accident. 
He is often anxious and masks his nervousness by blabbing on about maths and especially specific numbers like the housekeepers birthday or ???. 

## The authors connection to mathematics

## My Impression

## Mathematical prerequisites

This book was recommended to me by my mother who herself got the recommendation from my grandmother, both of which have never found great enjoyment in mathematics. 
So you can take it from them that this book doesn't require any familiarity with mathematics to be enjoyed.
On the contrary, I think "The Housekeeper and the Professor" tries to bring maths closer to those who have not previously enjoyed it. 
I invites you to follow the housekeepers and Roots explorations into the professors riddles and hopefully find a similar joy in them. 
Some of the reviews I read mentioned how they just skipped all the equations and explanations because they did not like maths. 
They still seemed to enjoy the book and ultimately I think you should read for your own enjoyment but I still feel they are missing out on a central premise of the book. 
I of course could not really experience this myself but I hope that this book could be a way for people to see the beauty in mathematics that so often is not visible in the maths taught in school. 

# 2. "Flatland - Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions" by Edwin A. Abbot (1884)

After deciding on my quest to read mathematical fiction, I of course needed to move on to what might be considered the absolute classic of this genre: Flatland.
It is such a classic that the local library in Bonn had it available and I think I had even seen an animated version of it at some math competition, although I remember nothing at all about it. 

## Brief Summary

The book is written from the perspective of a square-person living in a two-dimensional world called Flatland. 
The first half of the book discusses Flatland itself, while the second half discusses the squares encounters with other dimensions. 
While the book "Flatland" is known mostly for its mathematical content, more specifically for its explanation on how to imagine different dimensions, it is as much a book about maths as it is a satirical commentary on the society the author lived in (Victorian England).

The inhabitants of Flatland are all geometric shapes, ranging from lines, over triangles to spheres (or rather polygons with so many points that they are impossible to distinguish from spheres). 
Flatland has a rigid class system that is based on that geometry. 
We learn how the class system effects which jobs the inhabitants take on, what education they receive and how they behave in daily life. 
The square also explains important historic events that give us more insight into Flatlands culture and government (which is a monarchy). 

One day, the square has a dream in which he sees Lineland, a one dimensional world. We explore briefly what life looks like in Lineland, which is quite peculiar as the inhabitant cannot pass each other on the line and are therefore perpetually stuck in the same order. The square tries and fails to convince the monarch of Lineland that the second dimension exists. 

A little afterwards the square is visited by a sphere. It attempts to explain the third dimension. 
When the square isn't making much progress towards understanding, the sphere lifts it out of Flatland to look down upon it and at Spaceland. 
Seeing all this, the square begins to understand the nature of three dimensions and the abstract reasons for its existence. 
Back in Flatland the square tries to enlighten other people about the existence of three dimensions for which he is thrown in jail. (This isn't really a spoiler, it is mentioned in the preface of the book. ) 

## My Impression

I really liked this book. 
I think ot would be a great read for a book club as there are many different aspects to discuss: the satire of Victorian society, the mathematics of different dimensions and the portrayal of women. 
Having no idea whatsoever about Victorian England, I will skip this aspect and just say that the satire is still funny today and parts of it continue being relevant.
I will discuss the mathematical content in more detail in the section "Mathematical prerequisites". 
This aspect is extremely well done: the reader is led to consider how lower and higher dimensions might work in a very slow, fun and creative manner. 
It is never dull and there are drawings to illustrate parts of the text that might be slightly more difficult to understand. 

I want to dedicate the rest of the section to the authors portrayal of women in the book. 
Apparently, the possible sexism of the depiction itself was already criticised when the book came out as the preface addresses this criticism with the following words (written in the third person as if the author was conveying the thoughts of the square): 

> [I]n the course of an imprisonment of seven years he has himself modifies his own personal views, both as regards Women and as regards the Isosceles or Lower Classes.

and

> [W]riting as Historian, he has identified himself (perhaps too closely) with the views generally adopted by Flatland[.]

In a vacuum, the depiction of women is good satire: 
Women in Flatland are dangerous creatures, so dangerous in fact that they are prone to killing their entire families in fits of emotion.
For this reason, their lives are heavily regulated.
Despite this acute danger they are also described as very frail. 
Additionally, women are described as emotional and dumb. 
Every time the square wants to convey that something is easy to understand he says that even a woman could grasp it. 
All in all, I think this is still a funny and applicative satire of sexism. 

So then what is there to take issue with? 
All other societal aspects are not discussed in that literal of a manner, instead they try to fit logically into the peculiarities of Flatland. 
The author could imagine a world where the class system is based on the number of points of the polygons, 
where the hight of good culture is to recognize the shape of your conversation partner by sight, one where families of high status pay for their children to be surgically altered to have more points (often killing them in the process), and one where irregular shapes don't fit the preconceived moulds and are killed.
He could imagine another world (namely Lineland), in which marriages are formed by three people and all of life is carried out via verbal communication. 

But he could not imagine a world in which women would not be literally one dimension lower than their male counterparts and seen as hysterical and incapable of intelligent thought. 
It seems to have appeared so natural to him, that he didn't even think it necessary to find a metaphor for it. 
There are other concepts the book takes from our world without any change: monarchy, education and universities, houses, trees and rain for example.
The book thus presents the discrimination and inferiority of women as similarly natural.

Nevertheless, it is easy for me to forgive the author and see this as a natural product of the time (1884 in case you have forgotten), especially due to the admission to his past misguided views in the preface. 
Seeing monarchy among the list of "natural concepts" really puts the age of this book into perspective. 
For the 
Personally, I think that the satirical tone of the book makes it so the constant belittlement of women doesn't even leave a sour taste in your mouth. 
But I think it is an interesting aspect to keep in mind while reading and discussing. 

## The Authors Connection to Mathematics

Abbot (whose full name is Edwin Abbott Abbott btw) studied Mathematics at Cambridge and later became headmaster at a school in London. 
So you could say that mathematically he definitely knew what he was writing about. 

## Mathematical prerequisites

I don't think this book requires you to know any mathematics prior to reading it (except knowing what a triangle is and so on but I assume most people know this much). But unlike "The Housekeeper and the Professor", you won't have fun reading this if you're not willing to consider the mathematics presented. 

Additionally, you don't need to be afraid to see any complicated formulas in this book. The mathematical considerations are mostly limited to putting yourself in the shoes of someone living in two-dimensional space. 
(This might not seem very mathematical at first, but a lot of mathematics consists of gaining intuition by considering basic details of a object or space that is presented to you.)
As mentioned above the text is also adorned with drawings to help you understand the more technical explanations. 
To give you an idea of the level of mathematics in this book: I think the hardest idea presented in the book is how to get a line by combining infinitely many points, a square by combining infinitely many lines and a cube by combining infinitely many squares (and then considering how the number of points and faces evolves).

In fact, I think you will probably enjoy this book most if you are curious about mathematics but have not studied it further after school. You might notice that in the section about my impression I hardly comment on the mathematics. That is mostly because I already have a pretty okay understanding of how dimensions work and thus didn't get the feeling of enlightenment that a lot of people seem to experience after reading it.
