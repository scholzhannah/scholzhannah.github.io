Hi, my name is Hannah Scholz. I am happy you're visting my page :). This is very much a work in progress and I have no idea how to use jekyll so please excuse the mess...

I am a Master's student in mathematics in my third semester at the University of Bonn. I am especially interested in formalization using the proof assistant [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/). In this area I have mainly worked on formalizing the classical approach to CW complexes. Parts of this work have already made their way into Leans mathematical library [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).

Aside from mathematics I am also interested in supporting women (more broadly [FLINTA\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLINTA*) individuals) in STEM. If you're in Bonn check out the [Tea Time with Women in Mathematics](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/hcm/community/tea-time-with-women-in-mathematics); I co-organize some of these events and am currently the coordinator of the overall organization. I also participate in mentoring school-aged girls interested in STEM. If you would like to do that, too, check out [Cybermentor](https://www.cybermentorin.de/index.php/en/) which is the program I am participating in.
