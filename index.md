Hi, my name is Hannah Scholz. I am happy you're visting my page :). This is very much a work in progress and I have no idea how to use jekyll so please excuse the mess...

I am a Master's student in mathematics in my second semester at the University of Bonn. I am currently working as a research assistant for [Prof. Floris van Doorn](https://florisvandoorn.com/), spending eight hours a week on formalizing CW complexes in [Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/). See my github repository for this project [here](https://github.com/scholzhannah/CWComplexes).

Aside from mathematics I am also interested in supporting women in STEM. If you're in Bonn check out the [Tea Time with Women in Mathematics](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/hcm/community/tea-time-with-women-in-mathematics); I co-organize some of these events and am currently the coordinator of the overall organization. I also participate in mentoring school-aged girls interested in STEM. If you would like to do that, too, check out [Cybermentor](https://www.cybermentorin.de/index.php/en/) which is the program I am participating in.
