Hi, my name is Hannah Scholz (she/her). I am happy you're visting my page :). 

I am a Master's student in mathematics in my third semester at the University of Bonn. I am especially interested in formalization using the proof assistant [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/). In this area I have mainly worked on formalizing the classical approach to CW complexes. Parts of this work have already made their way into Leans mathematical library [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4). You can find the github repository of my project [here](https://github.com/scholzhannah/CWComplexes).

Aside from mathematics, I am also interested in supporting women (more broadly [FLINTA\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLINTA*) individuals) in STEM. I am currently the head of the department of equality and awareness of the [student council of mathematics in Bonn](https://www.fsmath.uni-bonn.de/en/home-page?set_language=en). I also coordinate the [Tea Time with Women in Mathematics](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/hcm/community/tea-time-with-women-in-mathematics) which is an event series for FLINTA*-individuals in Bonn. See more of what I do for equal opportunities in my [CV](https://scholzhannah.de/CV).
